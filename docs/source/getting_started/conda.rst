Python Environment Setup for PyBindings
=======================================

PyBindings allows you to seamlessly integrate C++ models with Python, combining the speed of C++ with the flexibility of Python. This setup enables you to run DynaPlex algorithms alongside state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms, use various neural network approximators like graph neural networks, and more.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Anaconda or Miniconda**: Install Anaconda or Miniconda, and ensure it is accessible from your command line.

2. **Python IDE**: Have a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) installed, such as PyCharm.

Environment Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow these steps to set up your Python environment and install the necessary libraries for PyBindings:

1. **Create a Python Virtual Environment**

   Open your Anaconda prompt or the terminal in your Python IDE. Navigate to the DynaPlex folder and run the following command::

.. code-block:: bash

   conda env create -f python/environment.yml

   This command sets up the Python virtual environment and installs the required libraries. Note that the initial installation may take some time.

2. **Update CMake User Presets**

   Open your ``CMakeUserPresets.json`` file and ensure that the ``WinPB`` block contains the correct paths to your newly created Python environment. Additionally, set ``dynaplex_enable_pythonbindings`` to ``true``.

3. **Generate Python Stub Files**

   Generate Python stub files for type hinting, navigate to the ``DynaPlex/python`` folder in your Anaconda prompt or Python IDE terminal and run the following commands::

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e .
   pip install pybind11-stubgen
   pybind11-stubgen -o ./ dp

   These commands generate Python stub files with a ".pyi" extension. These stub files provide type hint information for Python code, including third-party libraries.

4. **Build PyBindings in Your C++ IDE**

   In your C++ IDE, build the PyBindings to complete the setup.

5. **Start Using Python with DynaPlex**

   You are now ready to use Python with DynaPlex. Explore various example usages provided in the ``python/scripts`` folder. Note that if you make changes to the C++ code, you will need to rebuild the PyBindings.

Additional Notes (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're working on Snellius, you can load Conda via module environments using commands like:

   .. code-block:: bash

      module load 2022
      module load ...
