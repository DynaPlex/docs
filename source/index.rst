DynaPlex is a software library for solving Markov Decision Problems and similar models (POMDP, HMM) written primarily in C++20 with bindings for python. It supports 
deep reinforcement learning, approximate dynamic programming, classical parameterized policies, and exact methods based on policy and value iteration. Models in DynaPlex are written in C++, and exposed via a generic and vectorized interface. 

DynaPlex focuses on solving problems arising in Operations Management: Supply Chain, Transportation and Logistics, Manufacturing, etc. 

Cloning the Repository with Dependencies
----------------------------------------

When cloning the repository, it's essential to also download the required submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/WillemvJ/DynaPlexPrivate.git
```

if you did not recurse submodules, or if you use other tools for cloning repos, please somehow ensure that submodules (especially googletest) are available. 

.. note::

    If you are new to MDPs, you might benefit from first reading the :doc:`introduction to MDPs <getting_started/introduction_to_mdp>` and going thorugh the step-by-step tutorial, starting with the :doc:`MDP formulation <tutorial/airplane_mdp>` pages.
    If you just want to know how to install, setup, and add a model, see the docs under "Getting started"
